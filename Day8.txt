Access Modifier’s

Interface
-----------
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
Interface contains final and static variables.
Interface contains abstract methods.
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface keyword.
The methods in interface are public.


Multiple Inheritance using interface
----
Java Packages- folders whihc can have multiple files(classes, interfaces or anything else)
import packaname.classname;

1) User defined packages
2) Prefined packages
	Ex: java.util
	    java.sql


public
protected
default
private

private :The private access modifier is accessible only within class.

default: If you don't use any modifier, it is treated as default by default. 
The default modifier is accessible only within package(acrross multiple classes in the same package).

protected:
The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.

public: everywhere

Assignments
-------------

1) Write a program to demonstrate interface.
 Interface A :   int a, int b  sum()
Class B : Implements method from A and calculate sum of a and b

2. Write a program for multiple inheritance by using interface.
 Interface A  :  int a, int b add()
Interface B  :  int x, int y  mul()
Class Calculation :  Implements methods from A and B interfaces.
