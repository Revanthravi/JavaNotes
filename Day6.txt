this keyword
call by value & Call by reference
static keyword
System.out.println()
-------------------


call by value & Call by reference

-> call by value : we have to pass a value to a method as a parameter
-> call by reference : we have to pass object to a method as parameter

int a;
double d;
CallByRef a


ststatic keyword
-----------------
static variables
static methods
-----------------------
1) static methods can access only static stuff(static variables & static methods)-Directly without object creation
2) static methods can also access non-static stuff but through object creation.
3) Non-static methods can access every thing directly.


class Test
{
static String s="welcome";
}

Test.s.length()
-----------------------

class System
{
static PrintStream out;
}

System.out.print("welcomer.....")


Assignment
---------------------------

1) Create a class Calculation with the following methods. 

Class Name: Calculation

int sum(int x, int y)  :  Should accept two integer parameters and returns sum of two numbers.
int  sum(int x, int y, int z) : Should accept three integer parameters and returns sum of three numbers.
double sum(double x, double y)  : Should accept  two double type parameters and returns sum of two numbers.
double sum(double x, double y, double z) : Should accept  three double type parameters and returns sum of three numbers.

Now, create object for Calculations class  ‘cal’ then call different methods by passing different inputs.
